Final Project: Mapper on Joint Contour Net (JCN)
Weightage: 40%

Description:  

1. Compute JCN of real data (e.g. Nuclear Scission, Isabel Data)
2. Compute Mapper on JCN
3. Compute Simplified JCN using different strategies of the MOG-paper
4. Prepare a latex report on extraction of topological features (e.g. ‘nuclear scission’ or ‘eye of Isabel’)  in the above data
5. Submission deadline: 30th April, 2019
